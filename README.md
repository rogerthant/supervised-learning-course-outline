## Content Overview

This repository contains the course outline for "Introduction to Supervised Learning in Python". This course is designed to provide an introduction to supervised learning techniques using Python, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementation. It is not an in-depth course; rather, it aims to give learners a solid starting point in supervised learning.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

1. Explain the key concepts of supervised learning and distinguish between regression and classification problems
2. Implement and evaluate basic regression and classification models
3. Perform basic data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to inform model selection
4. Create and interpret visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships between variables
5. Evaluate the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics
6. Employ a train-test split and cross validation techniques for model validation
7. Improve model performance through basic hyperparameter tuning

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four chapters:

1. Foundations of Supervised Learning
2. Regression
3. Classification
4. Model Evaluation and Improvement

Each chapter consists of three or four lessons that build upon each other and provide a structured learning path.

## Target Audience

This course is ideal for:

- Beginners in machine learning and data science
- Programmers looking to expand their skills in data analysis and modeling
- Students and professionals interested in practical applications of supervised learning

## Prerequisites

Learners should have:

- Familiarity with fundamental statistical concepts
- Basic understanding of programming in Python
