# Introduction to Supervised Learning in Python

## Project Origin
This repository was initially created as part of a take-home assignment for a job application. While the position was ultimately not filled, I've decided to keep this repository public as it demonstrates my ability to structure educational content and create practical coding exercises in the field of data science.

## Content Overview
This repository contains an example course outline for "Introduction to Supervised Learning in Python". This course is designed to provide an introduction to supervised learning techniques using Python, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementation. It is not an in-depth course; rather, it aims to give learners a solid starting point in supervised learning.

[Rest of the original README content]

The course employs a hands-on approach. Learners will work with real-world datasets to implement and evaluate various supervised learning models. Through practical coding exercises, students will gain experience in data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation using popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

1. Explain the key concepts of supervised learning and distinguish between regression and classification problems.
2. Implement and evaluate basic regression and classification models.
3. Perform basic data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and simple feature engineering to inform model selection.
4. Create and interpret visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships between variables.
5. Evaluate the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics.
6. Identify and explain overfitting and underfitting, and understand their relationship to the bias-variance tradeoff.
7. Employ train-test splits and cross-validation techniques for model validation.
8. Improve model performance through basic hyperparameter tuning and regularization.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four chapters:

1. Foundations of Supervised Learning
2. Regression
3. Classification
4. Model Evaluation and Improvement

Each chapter consists of three or four lessons that build upon each other and provide a structured learning path.

## Target Audience

This course is ideal for:

- Beginners in machine learning and data science
- Programmers looking to expand their skills in data analysis and modeling
- Students and professionals interested in practical applications of supervised learning

## Prerequisites

Learners should have:

- Familiarity with fundamental statistical concepts (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)
- Basic understanding of programming in Python
