**Visualizing House Size vs. Price (Part of Lesson 1.3)**

You are now investigating the relationship between house size and price. Visualizing this relationship can provide valuable insights into the housing market trends and help in price predictions.

You have a dataset `house_data` with columns 'size' (in square feet) and 'price' (in thousands of dollars). You are going to create a scatterplot to visualize how house prices vary with size.

Matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as `plt`, and the dataset has been loaded for you.

**Instructions**
* Create a scatterplot with 'size' on the x-axis and 'price' on the y-axis.
* Set labels for the x-axis and y-axis.
* Add a title to the plot.
* Display the scatterplot.

```python
# Create a scatterplot of house size vs. price
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.____(house_data['____'], house_data['____'])

# Label the x-axis and y-axis
plt.____('Size (square feet)')
plt.____('Price (thousands of dollars)')

# Set the title
plt.____('House Size vs. Price')

# Display the scatterplot
plt.____()
```
